"""Tests that assert on repo wiring rather than on code.

Wiring is what rots: a pin reverted to `@v5` or a deleted Dependabot entry is a
one-line change whose absence is completely silent — nothing fails, the supply
chain just quietly goes back to being mutable. These make that fail a test.

`release.yml` holds `contents: write` to create the GitHub Release, so a
compromised action in that job can write to this repo and alter published release
artifacts. (#7)
